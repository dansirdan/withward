# withward

## Description

*withward* is the combination of the word "with" and the native English suffix ["-ward"](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/-ward), which is defined as denoting spatial or temporal direction, as specified by the initial element, such as toward; seaward; afterward; and backward.

For thousands of years, humans have traveled together to survive. If you are familiar with The Legend of Zelda, you may have come to know the quote, "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this." This [quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_dangerous_to_go_alone!) appears when Link is given a sword from the unnamed old man inside of the first cave of the game. This sword becomes instrumental in his quest to defeat Ganon and rescue princess Zelda. So, how does this help me understand *withward*? I'm glad you asked...

The idea of *withward* means to travel *with* someone toward any destination. The *withward* app will help you stay organized in your real life quests by connecting you with other users, keeping track of your visited and to-be-visited destinations, and allow you and your companions to contribute their ratings to a visited place.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
